            My First Title
        </h1>

        <p>I have to practice.</p>
        <p>&#60;link href="css/site.css" rel="stylesheet"/&#62; This is the way Bobby Davis writes it.</p>
        <p>&#60;link rel="stylesheet" href="cssFolder/site.css"/&#62; I wrote it like this because I guess it
            doesn't matter what order the two statements are in, rel and href.</p>
        <p>//In order to make the less-than and greater-than symbols, I had to use a technique where I had to use code:
        </p>
        <p>I started out with the appersand symbol "&". Then I used hashtag symbol "#". Then I used the number "60". And
            finally closed it with a semi-colon ";". </p>
        <p>All this was done to get "<". The same procedure was done to get the closing symbol ">" .</p> </body> </html>
